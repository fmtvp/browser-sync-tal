# BrowserSync TAL Plugin

Plugin that provides client-side scripts for [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/), supporting the transimission of key events to any [TAL](https://github.com/fmtvp/tal) application.

## What is TAL?

![TAL](http://fmtvp.github.com/tal/img/tal-logo-bw-small.jpg)

*TAL* was developed internally within the BBC as a way of vastly simplifying TV application development
whilst increasing the reach of BBC TV applications such as *iPlayer*. Today all of the BBC's HTML-based
TV applications are built using *TAL*.

## What does BrowserSync give us?

BrowserSync (with these TAL addons) allows us to launch a TAL application on a number of remote devices, and then remote-control those devices via a desktop browser.

## Use cases

* Live feedback of CSS or JS changes
* Regression testing prior to a release
* Explorative testing, discovering differences between different devices.

\* Support for device-to-device controlling would be interesting too *

## How do I get it setup?

Coming soon!
